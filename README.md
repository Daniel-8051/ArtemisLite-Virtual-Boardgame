# ArtemisLite-Virtual-Boardgame
A Monopoly-like, text-based virtual board game that runs on within the IDE console.
As part of my Software Engineering module, myself and a team of three classmates, where assigned the task of designing, implementing and testing our own piece of software that met the functionality requirements specified in the beginning. 
Apart from writing code, there was a focus on producing deliverables that showed evidence of design decision, mainly in the form of UML diagrams.
